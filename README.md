## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For this project, I decided to use some HTML5 semantic tags that I don't normally use such the "main"  and "article" tag. There were some rules that I wasn't aware of priot to this challenge.

```html
<main>
  <article>Content goes here</article>
</main>
```
