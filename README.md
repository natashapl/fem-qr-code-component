## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For this project, I decided to use some HTML5 sematic tags thayt i don;t normally use such the "main"  and "article" tag. There were some 

```html
<main>
  <article>Content goes here</article>
</main>
```

### Useful resources
